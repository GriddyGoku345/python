# Remember: A variable is just a container that holds
# (stores) a piece of data, such as a name or someone's age

# Define a variable called first_name and
# store the value 'Melissa' inside it
first_name = 'Melissa' # Assigning a string to the variable first_name
# first_name = "Melissa"
# first_name = "Mike"

# Assigning the value of 24 to the variable age
age = 24

# Predict the output
print(f'{first_name} is {age} years old.')
print(f"{first_name} is {age} years old.")
