# Variables Examples

# Remember: A variable is just a named location in your computer's memory
# You store a piece of data at that named location for future use

# Define a variable called first_name and
# store the value 'Melissa' at that named location in your computer's memory
first_name = 'Melissa' # Assigning a string to the variable first_name
last_name = "Barlow" # You can also use a pair of double quotes to assign a string to a variable


# Assigning the value of 24 to the variable age
age = 24

# Predict the output
print(f'{first_name} is {age} years old.')
