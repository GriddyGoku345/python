# Variables & Data Types Practice

# Demonstrate in this script that you know how to
# define (create) Python variables and
# assign string and numeric values to your variables

# Remember:
# A string is just a piece of text (Examples: Mikey, Traverse City, hot dog)
# An integer is a number that doesn't have a decimal point (Example: 42)
# A float (AKA floating-point number) is a number that does have a decimal point (Example: 3.2537)

# Part 1 / Strings
# Define a variable called school and assign it the string value Career Tech
# Define a variable called favorite_singer and assign it the string value that is your favorite singer
# Define a variable called greeting and assign it a string value you'd use to greet someone




# Part 2 / Numeric Data (Numbers)
# Define a variable called my_age and assign it your age as an integer
# Define a variable called pi and assign it the value of 3.1415926 (a float/floating-point number)
# Define a variable called room_length and assign it a value of 20.75 (a float/floating-point number)




# Part 3 / F-Strings
# Build an f-string that displays a custom greeting to your best friend
# Build an f-string that tells us your first name and the name of the school you attend
# Build an f-string that tells us in a sentence what the value of pi is.
