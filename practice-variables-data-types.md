# Practice: Python Variables 

## Submitting Your Work
 - Save your files to a new GitHub repo named: ***variables-intro***
 - Submit on Google Classroom the web address (URL) that points to your GitHub **variables-intro** repository

## Overview

Add a Python script named `variables101.py` to your repository that shows you know how to work with:
 - string variables
 - numeric variables (integers and floats)
 - the Python `print( )` function

## Directions

 - Add a comment block to the top of your script, like so:
 ```python
# Mike Jenkins
# 03 SEP 20XX
# Variables 101
```
- Use comments to divide your script into two sections
   - Numeric Variables
   - String Variables

- Under **Numeric Variables**:
  -  assign your age as an integer to a variable named `age`
  -  assign as an integer the number of people in your immediate family to a variable named `num_family_members`
  -  assign as a float how much you earn per hour at your job; name the variable `hourly_wage`
  -  use the `print ( )` function on three separate lines to print:
     - your age
     - the number of people in your family
     - how much you get paid per hour at your job

- Under **String Variables**:
  -  assign your last name to a variable named `last_name`
  -  assign the name of your sending school (or Career Tech) to a variable named `my_school`
  -  assign the name of one of your friends to a variable `my_friend`
  -  use the `print ( )` function on three separate lines to print:
     - your last name
     - the name of your school
     - your friend's name
