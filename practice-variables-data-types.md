# Practice: Python Variables 

## Submitting Your Work
 - Save your files to a new GitHub repo named: ***variables-intro***
 - Submit on Google Classroom the web address (URL) that points to your **variables-intro** repository

## Overview

Write a script that shows you know how to work with:
 - string variables
 - numeric variables (integers and floats)
 - the Python `print( )` function

## Helpful Resources

- Look at the 
 
## Directions

 - Add a comment block to the top of your script, like so:
 ```python
# Mike Jenkins
# 03 SEP 20XX
# Variables Intro
```
- Use comments to divide your script into two sections
   - Numeric Variables
   - String Variables

- Under **Numeric Variables**:
  -  assign your age as an integer to a variable named `age`
  -  assign as an integer the number of people in your immediate family to a variable named `num_family_members`
  -  assign as a float how much you earn per hour at your job; name the variable `hourly_wage`
  -  use the `print ( )` function on three separate lines to print:
    - your age
    - the number of people in your family
    - how much you get paid per hour at your job

- Under **String Variables**:
  -  assign your last name to a variable named `last_name`
  -  assign the name of your sending school to a variable named `sending_school`
  -  assign the name of one of your pets to a variable `my_pet`


> ```python
> # Printing my last name
> print(f'My last name is {last_name}.')
>
> # Printing my age
> print(f"I am {age} years old.")
